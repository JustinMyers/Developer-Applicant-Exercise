Dear Hedgeye Team,

I want to thank you for your consideration for this role. Several times
in my life I have had the good fortune to have my personal interests play
a big part in my work. The work becomes more enjoyable and I'm able to
bring a lot more to the table due to my background. For example, at
CTI Solutions Inc. one of our customers is Blizzard Entertainment - and I
have played way too much World of Warcraft. Being able to visit their campus
professionally and work with their licensing team was an amazing experience.

Pursuing this role with Hedgeye is a similar confluence of my professional
skills and personal interests. In 2021 I began pursuing investing for the
first time in my life. I opened an online brokerage account but soon
felt that I had questions bigger than I could answer. I've been reading tons
of books, getting up at 6 AM PST to watch Bloomberg TV and, yes, lurking on
r/wallstreetbets, to get as wide a perspective as I can.

I've even built tools to help me have perspective on what's happening
in the markets. For my first attempt I created a simple Ruby on Rails app and
fed it 10 years of daily candle data pulled from Yahoo! Finance. I asked it to
do find correlations between stocks in the S&P 500. It created millions of rows
of data and took several days to complete - but the answers were interesting.
I'm now in the process of improving my initial naive approach with better tools
such as Apache Spark.

The chance to once again blend my personal passions with professional excellence
is extremely compelling. I'm looking forward to getting to know your technical
team better through the interview process.

Best,
Justin Myers
