What are your opinions on Agile software development?
I'm for it. What I value the most is the way that agile demands stakeholder involvement.
There is an XKCD cartoon where a developer is told "you'll never find a programming language
that frees you from the burden of clarifying your ideas". Agile places the responsibility
for clarifying ideas to the whole product team. The ability to triage and minimize the scope
of work into to unambiguous deliverables is essential.

TDD or BDD?
I've had success adhering to TDD in Rails, with models and views.

Where I've struggled is in places where the behavior is not strictly defined, or
where you are prototyping. In such instances I've seen teams either let their tests
languish or even just paste the output straight into the tests to get them to pass.

TDD requires clear expectations and a full team commitment.

What are you looking for in a job?
My first interest is to care about the human impact of the role. What problems are we solving
for people? I've worked in licensing (with IP holders whose products I care about), childhood
education (my daughter attended Trackers), and in addiction recovery (important family connections).

At Hedgeye I am excited to feed my passion for understanding investing. I feel the market is a
venue for understanding "the interconnectedness of all things". It is a tool for providing
for one's future as well as a window into the whole of human endeavor.

Beyond this I value the opportunity to learn from my colleagues and become a better developer. I also
hope to find ways to gain mentorship and management experience. I would like those to be a bigger part
of my career moving forward.
